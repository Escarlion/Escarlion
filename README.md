**About:** *Having been my final project (TCC), this game took about a year and a half to develop. Its scope was reduced due to some issues during production, but it was delivered.*  

*It was a very interesting experience to work on it, as at the time, it was my largest project and the first where I took an active role in programming, rather than just focusing on the art. It was also my first project in Unity.*  

*This is a game I hold very dear and would love to remake in my own way now that I have more experience.*

**About:** *As my most recent project, it has been an interesting challenge to treat it as a product made for others to play, targeting a specific audience, while considering marketing and monetization techniques using platforms like <a href="https://lewdbytesstudio.itch.io">Itch.io</a> and <a href="https://patreon.com/AppartmentAffairs">Patreon</a>.*  
*It has been a highly interesting and challenging project, but one that I am excited to continue.*
